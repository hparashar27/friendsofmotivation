This website is basically a landing page of the "Friends of meditation" made up from the latest Frontend web technology React.js which is a library of ( javascript ES6 ) and for styling it i used CSS3 modules . I made it from scratch by myself , even all the UI/UX components like (videos,presentations) are also prepared by me with the ( Canva and figma ) tools and for the all the pictures and graphics i took help from instagram,Facebook and amazon store account of friends of meditation . I hope you all will like it and i will wait for you response 
Thankyou .
